Lecture notes - Mathematics PhD Brush-up course

This repository contains a set of lecture notes for a PhD brush-up course in Real Analysis and Optimization. The whole text is divided into six sections, covering basic
topological analysis, metric and normed spaces, sequences and convergence, notion of open, closed sets, boundedness and compactness, the notion of continuity,
convexity and differentiability for real functions, solution of optimization problems and basic integration. The lecture notes are complemented by two problem sets.
