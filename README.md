Lecture notes - Mathematics PhD Brush-up course

This repository contains a set of lecture notes for an introductor course in Real Analysis and Optimization, plus two homeworks.

The whole text is divided into six sections, covering basic topological analysis, metric and normed spaces, sequences and convergence, notion of open and closed sets, boundedness and compactness, notion of continuity, convexity and differentiability for real functions, solution of optimization problems and basic integration. 

These lecture notes were used for a PhD brush-up course at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB).
